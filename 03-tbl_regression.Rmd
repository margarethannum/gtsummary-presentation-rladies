- it's not pretty

- most often I want the odds ratios from a logistic regression, not the betas

- format from every type of model is different and difficult to work with

**`broom::tidy()` output**

♥ Using `broom::tidy()` a step in the right direction!

♥ Option to exponentiate

- MUCH MUCH better!

- all models returned with consistent format

- but does not include reference groups

- still needs additional modification before it can be presented

### **{gtsummary} Output**
.large[
`tbl_regression()` accepts regression model object as input. Uses {broom} in the background, outputs table with nice defaults:

  ♥ Reference groups added to the table  
  ♥ Sensible default number rounding and formatting  
  ♥ Label attributes printed  
  ♥ Certain model types detected  
  ♥ Estimate header and footnote included

- This table is ready for publication in a single line of code!

- That is something no other package I know of can do

- The back end for the function is {broom} and {gt}, meaning that there is broad support for most regression model types, and the resulting tables are gorgeous and customizable.

- Common regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox regression, are automatically identified and the tables are created with appropriate headers. 

- build the regression model on your own....we are not in the business of model estimation or checking

- side-by-side regression results is common in cancer research (e.g. time to recurrence, then time to death)

- stacking two or more models is also possible

- easy to create custom tables that are formatted beautifully

???

- Tables of univariate results can be good for exploratory analysis

- Code is similar to {ggplot2} `geom_smooth()` and `stat_smooth()`

- also great with time-to-event endpoint when you cannot do a `tbl_summary()` to get bivariate p-values

# {gtsummary} reporting results with inline_text()
.large[
- Tables are important, but we often need to report results in-line in a report.

- Any statistic reported in a {gtsummary} table can be extracted and reported in-line in a R Markdown document with the `inline_text()` function.

```{r, comment=""}
inline_text(tbl_reg_1, variable = trt, level = "Drug B")
```

- The pattern of what is reported can be modified with the `pattern = ` argument.  

- Default is `pattern = "{estimate} ({conf.level*100}% CI {conf.low}, {conf.high}; {p.value})"`.
]

???

- discuss importance of reproducible results

- data is constantly updating

- this functionality assures you won't miss updating a reported estimate in a document

- for me, this is one the most powerful parts of the {gtsummary} package

- something I've never seen in another package
