**Raw data summary**

⚠ Difficult to work with

⚠ Need to convert character to factor variables

⚠ Dichotomous variables coded 0/1 are treated as numeric for descriptive statistics

⚠ Takes a lot of work to get this into a presentable table!

- it's not pretty

- most often I want the odds ratios from a logistic regression, not the betas

- format from every type of model is different and difficult to work with

.large[**Example: Summarizing clinical trial data in one line of code with `tbl_summary()`**]

```{r, results = FALSE}
tbl_summary(sm_trial) #<<
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
# tbl_summ_1a <- sm_trial %>% tbl_summary()
# gtsave(tbl_summ_1a %>% as_gt(), filename = "images/tbl_summary_1a.png")
```

Notice some nice default behaviors:  
  ♥ Detects variable types of input data and calculates descriptive statistics  
  ♥ Variables coded as 0/1, TRUE/FALSE, and Yes/No are presented dichotomously.  
  ♥ Recognizes `NA` values as "missing" and lists them as unknown  
  ♥ Label attributes automatically printed  
  ♥ Variable levels indented and footnotes added with _({gt})_

- This is an abbreviated version of the example data used in the package help files/documentation. 

- Returns a nicely formatted table with sensible rounding and formatting

- `by =` argument to split table by a categorical variable
- `add_p()` - default tests are the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables, chi-square test of independence/ Fisher's exact test for categorical (Fisher's for low expected counts).
- `add_overall()` - to add back in an overall summary of the data (not split by the `by` argument)

- Go slow here

- summarizing a data set is the MOST important analysis

- summarize data first!  you will often catch mistakes.  Data is complicated, and understanding it up front is important.

- Communicating a summary of the data ALONG with analytic results in necessary (others may catch mistakes you're not aware of)

- {gtsummary} is for presenting results, other great packages are available for summarizing data for your self (e.g. skimr)

- just one line of code

- all functions beginning with `tbl_*` create a new tables

- this is how I used the package 95% percent of the time...so easy

- three types of data shown here (explain them)

**Customize further using formula syntax and tidy selectors**
]

```{r, results = FALSE}
tbl_summary_3 <- sm_trial %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    statistic = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
      all_categorical() ~ "{n} / {N} ({p}%)"), 
    label = age ~ "Patient Age") %>%
  add_p(test = all_continuous() ~ "t.test")
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
# gtsave(tbl_summary_3 %>% as_gt(), filename = "images/tbl_summary_3.png")
```

.medium[
- `statistic` - Report mean and standard deviation for continuous (default is median)
- `label` - Specify label for age
- `type` - Specify variable types
- `digits` - Specify number of decimals to round to
- `test`  [`add_p()`] - Report t-test p-values all continuous (default is Wilcoxan Rank Sum)

- defaults are great, let's change the default behavior

- statistics can be changed to anything...literally any R function (e.g. variance)

- discuss the formula notation
    - it's like `case_when()`, condition/variable on LHS and result on RHS
    - one formula doesn't need to be in a list, but more than one must be listed

- the vignette has more examples

**Additional `tbl_summary` Features**
]

.medium[
- Use **{tidyselect}** functions to select variables for customization
- Use **custom functions** for calculating p-values and reporting any statistic for continuous variables (including user-written functions)
- **Formatting** functions to bold and italicize labels and levels
- **Missing data** options
- **Sort variables** by significance (`sort_p()`); sort categorical variables by frequency  
- Calculate **cell percents and row percents** (default is column-wide)  
- Only report p-values for select variables (`add_p(include = ...)`); report q-values (like false discovery rate)  
- **Rounding options** and ability to **set global options** for rounding p-values

- There is more I'm not covering here. Many options in the vignette.
